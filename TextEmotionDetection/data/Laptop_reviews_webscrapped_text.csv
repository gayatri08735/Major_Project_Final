I got it for around 41k ish and it's costly because we have semiconductor crisis going on currently, but the laptop performs well, has good battery backup, bright screen and smooth experience and yes charges quick!! I guess it would take it 1hr 30 min approximately and it would last around 5hrs while you are surfing the internet and and more than that if it's not connected to any Internet.
I basically bought it for academic purpose and it fulfills all my needs, and yes I am writing this review after 10days of usage and as of now it does collaborate with all my needs!!

This is a good laptop for day to day usage. Please note that this is not for games however you can play some light games. If you want the best performance install a SSD which will improve the performance drastically. There is no lags or glitches after installing SSD. The battery life is 2 to 3 hours with one full cycle of charge. Of course it depends on your usage. As off now I have not faced any major issues though I am running Windows 11. Built quality is average. Lastly the delivery from Amazon was excellent. Thanks Amazon team. Keep it up. If you are a average user you can blindly go for it with a SSD installed in the device.,,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 January 2022

Overall nice laptop.,"Nice laptop for kids having online classes and want to play some games. I would say it might not be the best gaming laptop but in the title it said FHD gaming laptop but now it doesn't. So i was confused but after a few processor speed changes it works really well, In fact i even play games like Fortnite, Valorant and some more with a constant 40-50 fps. So overall it is satisfying. And for the biggest question it has a battery life 5-6 hrs while attending online classes and can handle a game for like an hour.
One small disappointment was it came with a Intel UHD graphics which were a bit low compared to this laptop. Loving it since bought Its been 6 months since bought but no problem till now and its pretty sturdy material too so would suggest buying.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51A1mmrA2rL.88.jpg

I got it for 41.3k, and though its original configuration is fine too, I added 8gb additional RAM for 3.2k, so for 44.5k I've got a laptop that's blazingly fast for general use.
I don't use it for gaming, only for office work and as a home computer, and for that it's fantastic. Boot up time is 5-7 sec, shutdown is 2 sec, Windows 10 and MS Office are pre-installed with lifetime validity.
I have a similar HP 15 with the Ryzen 3 and though the specs on that are better on paper, the i3 version seems to be far better in real world performance.
All in all, a great buy.

Update: One month plus of regular use of around 10 hours a day and everything's still as great, no problems at all have come up in this duration.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 April 2021

Additionally the 1 TB HDD is useful for storage. Warranty is updated correctly once you setup. Some bloatware exist as you would expect from any laptop with pre-installed software. Some of the keys are a little hard to press, but not too much. The power and charging indicators at the sides might make people desiring for a better design.

There is no graphic card. While SSD might make game faster along with 8 GB RAM, lack of a dedicated graphic card means it's not that good with games.

And the worst part is customer services are not even helping they are just asking to remove the Temporary file. The funny part is, how much temporary file data will be there for 10-15 days old laptop :)

The HP Laptop technical support team says that it doesn't support Memory: 4/8 GB DDR4-2666 MHz RAM with Windows 10, HP is requesting me to upgrade to 8 GB RAM or 16 GB RAM to work the laptop properly. requesting you not buy this laptop. I asked to return but nothing has happened. Please please do not buy this product.

Speed: It is good for all Microsoft office functions which are the basic ones. It came loaded with Windows10 and was updated automatically to Windows 11. Having 8 GB RAM helps in multi tasking with multiple desktops and tabs.
Display is impressive and works best if the Chrome is preset to 90% zoom.
